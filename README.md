Both files, windows and linux, arent ready to use upon downloading, you need to edit the script to put YOUR headphone name.

For the windows version, you need to create a dotnet project (preferably .net 8), a paste the script then compile.
For the linux script you will need to have python installed.

I do not plan on creating an executable since it is not configured with your headphone, and neither i plan on making it that way.
